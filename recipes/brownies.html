            <li>1 1/2 cups granulated sugar</li>

            <li>2/3 cup cocoa powder, sifted if lumpy</li>
            <li>1/2 cup powdered suger, sifted if lumpy</li>
            <li>1/2 cup dark chocolate chips</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspons sea salt</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 cup canola oil or extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 325Â°F. Lightly spray an 8x8 baking<br>
                dish (not a 9x9 dish or your brownies will overcook) with<br>
                cooking spray and line it with parchment paper. Spray the<br>
                parchment paper.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a medium bowl, combine the sugar, flour, cocoa powder,<br>
                powdered sugar, chocolate chips, and salt. 
            </li>
            <li>
                In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, olive oil,<br>
                water, and vanilla.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sprinkle the dry mix over the wet mix and stir until<br>
                just combined.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour the batter into the prepared pan (it'll be thick -<br>
                that's ok) and use a spatula to smooth the top. Bake<br>
                for 40 to 48 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out<br>
                with only a few crumbs attached (note: it's better to<br>
                pull the brownies out early than to leave them in too long).<br>
                Cool completely before slicing.*** Store in an airtight<br>
                container at room temperature for up to 3 days.<br>
                These also freeze well!
            </li>
        </ol>
